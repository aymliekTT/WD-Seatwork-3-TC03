## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming is in camel case.
   - Camel case is a naming format where there is no white space in the separation of each word, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding word's first letter is in upper followed by lower case letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```

└─ assets
|   └─ css
|   |   └─ style.css
|   └─ img
|   |   └─ fileWith.jpeg/.jpg/.webp/.png
